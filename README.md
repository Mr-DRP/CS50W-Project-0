Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi! It is my first project in **CS50x**. I learned the concept of basic html, css, bootstrap and use of sass for easy css generation.
There are 4 files as per the project requirement.

## index.html

It is the main page of my project. I have created nav bar using bootstrap 4. Implemented img tag and Bootstrap grid model in this page. Use of ordered list can been found at bottom of the page.

## blog.html
I have taken a sample article from [ArticlesFactory](https://articlesfactory.com). Used basic html tags like `<span>,<a>` and `<h3>`. CSS is use to align heading to center. A table is created using bootstrap elements.

## about.html

This part contains image and a heading with some contents. `<ul>` has been used.

## contact.html

This page contains simple contact form with email field and textarea.

SCSS implementation has been done in customstyles.scss file and style.css contains basic css with different selectors.
